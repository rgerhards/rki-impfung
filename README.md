RKI Data on Germany SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

Subdirectory "excel" contains the original RKI excel sheets with vax data.
Please note: excel table layout changes from time to time. So you need to
adapt your scripts accordingly.

The data set is automatically downloaded each days except sunday. Sundays
the RKI does not update the spreadsheet. Note that the github archive is
**not updated daily**. If you need a refresh, just ping me.

##Official download capability
I would like to mention the download capability at "Impfdashboard". On quick
glimpse, it contains all the data, and is also updated when corrections happen.
However, I did not yet have time to really check it out and evaluate changing
my system over to this data source.

##My site on vaccination stats
I began to import the data to provide a page on vaccination stats. It still is
not showing all the data, but you may want to check it for additional updates.
Note: page is in German.
