RKI Data on Germany SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

Subdirectory "excel" contains the original RKI excel sheets with vax data.
Please note: excel table layout changes from time to time. So you need to
adapt your scripts accordingly.

The data set is automatically downloaded each days except sunday. Sundays
the RKI does not update the spreadsheet. Note that the github archive is
**not updated daily**. If you need a refresh, just ping me.
